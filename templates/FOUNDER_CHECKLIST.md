You don't need to do everything. Pick what matters most for YOUR goals:
- **Want revenue?** Focus on marketing (Section 6)
- **Want peace of mind?** Focus on monitoring (Section 2)
- **Want to scale?** Focus on automation and docs (Section 4)
- **Want to sleep at night?** Focus on legal (Section 1)

Start anywhere. Make progress. Iterate.
