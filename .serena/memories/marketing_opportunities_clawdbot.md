# Clawd.bot Community Marketing Opportunities

**Date identified:** Jan 25, 2026
**Status:** Ready to post once SaneApps websites updated (target: Jan 26)
**Channel:** GitHub Discussions at github.com/clawdbot/clawdbot
**Community size:** 23.7k stars, 2.8k forks — privacy-first, local-first audience
**Note:** Reddit unavailable (shadowbanned). Spacing posts over a few days.

## Post #1 — Discussion #1748: "Clawdbot x Claude Code"
**URL:** https://github.com/clawdbot/clawdbot/discussions/1748
**Context:** Someone asking how to connect Clawdbot to Claude Code CLI. We ARE the Claude Code infrastructure people.
**Angle:** Answer their question with genuine expertise, mention SaneProcess hooks/skills, link to saneapps.com.
**Draft:**
> I've been building Claude Code hooks and skills for my macOS apps — enforcement hooks that prevent bad patterns, auto-capture learnings, etc. Happy to share what I've learned about the CLI's hook system if anyone's wiring this up. Privacy-first is core to how I build — everything local, no cloud dependency. Working on this at saneapps.com if anyone wants to check it out or get involved.

## Post #2 — Discussion #1717: "Dev dodging the charge"
**URL:** https://github.com/clawdbot/clawdbot/discussions/1717
**Context:** Post says "bold, local-first project... hope we can keep it out of big tech claws." Philosophically aligned.
**Angle:** Agree with their values, share what we're building, invite devs.
**Draft:**
> 100% this. Local-first, user-owned — that's exactly the philosophy behind what I'm building too. Small macOS utilities that respect your machine and your data. No telemetry, no cloud lock-in. saneapps.com if you're curious — always looking for devs who share this mindset.

## Post #3 — Discussion #379: "security: introduce secret detection for clawd"
**URL:** https://github.com/clawdbot/clawdbot/discussions/379
**Context:** About preventing AI from leaking secrets via hooks. SaneProcess does exactly this for Claude Code.
**Angle:** Contribute genuine technical insight about pre-tool-use hooks, mention SaneApps.
**Draft:**
> Love this direction. I built something similar for Claude Code — pre-tool-use hooks that block operations before they execute (path restrictions, circuit breakers, secret detection). The hook-based approach works well because you catch it before the damage, not after. Happy to compare notes — privacy-first tooling is what I do at saneapps.com.

## Assessment
- **Monetization:** ClawdHub has no paid marketplace — no direct revenue path
- **Value:** Brand awareness with aligned audience, potential dev contributors, backlinks
- **Risk:** Low — all posts contribute genuine value, not spam
- **SaneSync verdict:** Does NOT rescue SaneSync. Graveyard confirmed.
