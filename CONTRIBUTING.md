## Become a Contributor (Even if You Don't Code)

Are you tired of waiting on the dev to get around to fixing your problem?  
Do you have a great idea that could help everyone in the community, but think you can't do anything about it because you're not a coder?

Good news: you actually can.

Copy and paste this into Claude or Codex, then describe your bug or idea:

```text
I want to contribute to this repo, but I'm not a coder.

Repository:
https://github.com/sane-apps/SaneProcess

Bug or idea:
[Describe your bug or idea here in plain English]

Please do this for me:
1) Understand and reproduce the issue (or understand the feature request).
2) Make the smallest safe fix.
3) Open a pull request to https://github.com/sane-apps/SaneProcess
4) Give me the pull request link.
5) Open a GitHub issue in https://github.com/sane-apps/SaneProcess/issues that includes:
   - the pull request link
   - a short summary of what changed and why
6) Also give me the exact issue link.

Important:
- Keep it focused on this one issue/idea.
- Do not make unrelated changes.
```

If needed, you can also just email the pull request link to hi@saneapps.com.

I review and test every pull request before merge.

If your PR is merged, I will publicly give you credit, and you'll have the satisfaction of knowing you helped ship a fix for everyone.
